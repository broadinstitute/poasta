## [0.1.0](https://github.com/broadinstitute/poasta/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2025-07-08

The first release of POASTA. POASTA is still very much in active development,
and APIs and CLIs are subject to change.

This version includes

- `poasta` CLI for computing partial order alignments, supporting gap-affine and two-piece cost models (thanks @ekg).
- `lasagne` CLI for computing sequence-to-DAG alignments, outputing alignments in GAF format. **(ALPHA)**
